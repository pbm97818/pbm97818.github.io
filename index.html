		<h1>Free Market Capitalism: Why it Works</h1>
		<h2>My Story</h2>
		<P>When I was nine, I started my own landscaping company, working during the summers and after school
		during the school year.	In my first year, I earned upwards of $20 an hour, and made over $1,500. Since then,
		I have grown my company to around $30,000 in sales, and have learned a great 
		deal about business. I have become a responsible person that understands the value of a dollar and has a 
		good work ethic. This is a great example of why government interference in business is never a 
		good idea.</P>
		<h3>Government Interference</h3>
		<P>Because the folks that run the government rarely know anything about economics, any time the 
		government creates laws that hinder free market practices, inefficiencies occur. Imagine a "ladder
		of success." Every law that lawmakers create that hinders free market principles eliminates 
		some of the bottom rungs of the ladder. This makes it harder for people, especially young people to
		climb the "ladder of success." Click <a HREF=capitalism.html>here</a> to learn how to make markets 
		and people more free and more successful.</P>
