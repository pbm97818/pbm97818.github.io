			<td>Law</td><td>How the law hinders business</td><td>How to fix it</td><td>Results of fixing it</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Minimum wage</td><td>Employers have to pay a high amount of money for labor. This drives labor 
			costs up for employees that might have been willing to work at a lower wage. Forcing someone to 
			work at a given wage without their consent violates their freedom and their 13th amendment right
			to not be forced into slavery or involuntary servitude. Along those lines, forcing a business to 
			pay an employee a federally mandated wage violates that business's freedom and could be considered
			a type of reverse slavery.</td>
			<td rowspan=2>Eliminate it</td><td>Employers will hire people who are willing to work at
			a wage lower than the current federally mandated minimum wage. This will drive down labor costs, causing 
			prices of goods to go down, and allowing everyone to purchase goods cheaper. Also, younger people or 
			people with lesseducation will be able to get a low-paying job and work their way up the ladder of success by 
			gaining experience in the labor force day after day. This experience will help them be able to make
			more money and be more successful than if they were not able to be hired by the company to begin
			with.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Child labor laws</td><td>Young people who want to work are not legally allowed to work. This has 
			resulted in a very lazy generation of people suckling at the government teat, living in their 
			parents' basements, wanting free college, and crying for free health care. Tens of thousands of young
			adults are not responsible and do not have a good work-ethic. One of the reasons for this is because
			they were not allowed to work as a kid, so they never developed that work-ethic. 
			</td><td>This works hand-in-hand with getting rid of the minimum wage. Employers are
			able to hire cheaper employees, assuming those employees agree to working at the wage offered 
			by the employer. For example, eliminating child labor laws allows a kid at the age of seven to
			agree to work for someone at an hourly wage of $2.00. The child's parents are proud because their kid
			is learning invaluable lessons such as the value of a dollar and good work-ethic. The child is also 
			gaining experience in the work force so that he can be able to work his way up the aforementioned "ladder 
			of success." This allows him to make more and more money each year so that when he starts college, he is 
			a responsible young adult earning far more than $20.00 an hour. This is very hypothetical, but it does
			show the positive ramifications of eliminating child labor laws.</td>
